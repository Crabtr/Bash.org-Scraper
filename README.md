# Bash.org Scraper

Two Python scripts to scrape every quote from [Bash.org](http://bash.org).

You'll need Python 3 installed as well as
[requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/2.7.0) and
[BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.4.1).

* Use **Scrape - Same File.py** to have every quote written to the same file.

* Use **Scrape - Seperate Files.py** to have every quote written to it's own file
based on the page it was pulled from.
